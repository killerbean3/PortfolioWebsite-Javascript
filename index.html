        <p>
          I have loved computers for as long as I can remember, from when I
          built my first PC at age fourteen to when I got my first virus on my
          laptop at age eight and had to get rid of it myself so my dad didn't
          tell me off! Computers have held a special place in my heart! I enjoy
          not only working on the hardware of computers but also the software! I
          started developing programs in Scratch at an early age, I'd guess
          around 9, then moved on to Python, C, Javascript, and many more. On
          the hardware side, I loved making and tinkering with the PCs I had
          made. I have worked on liquid-cooled PCs, to now more technical
          devices like servers, routers, and switches. This allows me to run my
          home server which runs as not only a file server for my local network
          but outside my LAN too, in a sense creating my own cloud storage for
          my friends. To learn more about these projects and my experience,

          I also do public speaking about mental health and my experience. This
          ties into the job I currently work at. I have spoken in front of many
          professionals and students to help them better understand mental
          health and what it feels like to be in the situation as I am now on
          the other side. This is more of a passion project as I love to help
          others, you can see my work at
