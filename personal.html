          The first project that I have is the very website you are on right
          now! The site is developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I tried to
          keep it basic but beautiful as that is my design philosophy for many
          things I do! The source code is available by inspecting this in your
          browser. One of the things you may notice is a lot of my text,
          including this text is in .txt files. This is to keep my code on my
          HTML simple and easy to read, my personal feeling is that I do not
          like my HTML filled with text. I used JS to fill it with text. This
          also allows the text to be updated with just the file.

    <!-- Home Server -->

        <h2>home <span>server</span></h2>
        <p>
          I run a home server that runs its own Linux OS(Unraid). I started this
          venture by buying an old workstation from a website called Cash
          Converters it had a Xeon® CPU E3-1241 v3, which is a quad-core with 8
          threads. 12GB of RAM. A 120 GB SSD and a raedeon HD6670. This cost me
          £100 and I had to make a few upgrades before I could use it. The first
          of these upgrades is storage as a storage server with 120GB wasn't
          going to cut it. I bought 2x 8TB Ironwolf Pro HDDs and used one as a
          parity drive and one as a data drive. Next was a new case, PSU, with
          more drives and more RAM. I upgraded the RAM from an 8GB and 4GB stick
          to 4x8GB sticks to give me 32GB. Currently, as of writing this has
          39TB of storage with an 8TB parity and 2x500GB cache SSDs, 500w PSU,
          and a Silverstone CS380. Next, I will go into more depth about
          specific parts of the system. Unraid is a powerful, easy-to-use
          operating system for self-hosted servers and network-attached storage.
          Its main benefits are the ability to add drives as you go, No RAID
          (hence the name Unraid), UNIX-based, massive community, and easy
          setup. Out of all of these, my main reason for using Unraid was the
          "add as you go" ability in unraid meaning I started with 2 drives and
          added more later.

          Docker Containers can be pulled, customized, and installed almost
          instantly with the community apps plugin installed. this allows for
          systems to be set up and run very quickly. Below are pictures of my
          docker containers (some are blurred for privacy-related reasons). The
          one I would like to speak more on is PIHole. PiHole is an open-source
          adblocking, tracker-blocking, and telemetry-blocking utility that I
          swear by. this docker version also uses DoT and DoH which stands for
          DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS. DNS over TLS is a network security
          protocol for encrypting and wrapping Domain Name System (DNS) queries
          and answers via the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. The goal
          of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing
          eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data via man-in-the-middle
          attacks. The well-known port number for DoT is 853. DNS over HTTPS
          (DoH) is a protocol for performing remote Domain Name System (DNS)
          resolution via the HTTPS protocol. A goal of the method is to increase
          user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation
          of DNS data by man-in-the-middle attacks[1] by using the HTTPS
          protocol to encrypt the data between the DoH client and the DoH-based
          DNS resolver. This device grabs the DNS queries from a publically
          available DNS provider securely then uses the resolution on its own
          and creates its own DNS database so I don't have to rely on external
          DNS providers. PiHole has so many features that I cannot tell you them
          all and I'd rather link you to their official website for you to have
          a look yourself. I also use a docker container of OwnCloud which is
          like OneDrive but it's stored on my server, not someone else's. This
          is used by multiple people outside my network too who connect via
          either a tunnel or reverse proxy depending on who it is, essentially
          making me run my own cloud service. a smaller thing is I also run my
          own game servers on this that people can connect to and are
          port-forwarded for people to connect outside my network.

        <p>
          You can also set up your shares in Unraid and it is compatible with
          Linux, MacOS, and Windows out of the box. The shares I use are
          MainShare, Backups, Media, OwnCloud, appdata, and isos. You can also
          set up users with different permissions.

          Tunneling is a great way to access data and devices when away from the
          home. I have 2 tunnels set up on my server, one for me and one for my
          girlfriend. Tunneling is a method for transporting data across a
          network using protocols that are not supported by that network.
          Tunneling works by encapsulating packets: wrapping packets inside of
          other packets. (Packets are small pieces of data that can be
          re-assembled at their destination into a larger file). Tunneling is
          often used in virtual private networks (VPNs). It can also set up
          efficient and secure connections between networks, enable the usage of
          unsupported network protocols, and in some cases allow users to bypass
          firewalls. My tunnels are through a Wireguard VPN and are mainly used
          so me and her can route our phone traffic through my server, to the
          PiHole device to help keep our data secure even when away from home.
          But it could be used for file access and more.

        <p>
          I am also currently developing a video game in an engine called
          Impactjs. I had previously worked in Unity but with recent
          controversies, I have moved over to impactjs. I may move over again
          but right now I'm about 300 hours into development and moving now
          would be a costly measure. I won't go much into this as it's still a
          small project with only about 7 - 10 hours of content but it is a
          story-driven RPG about a young man who has to find his dad's killer. I
          wanted to focus on the story since I am a one-man dev team and I
          cannot compete with the quality of even small indie studios in terms
          of graphics etc. So creating a good story and mechanics is a way to go
          for this. This project is going to have a release to Steam and my
          website once finished but it is a side project and I am taking the
          time it needs in the oven to be right. The game will basically be
          complied as a web app for most purposes as it adds so much
          functionality. I could use a web app on phones, PCs, the internet and
          even consoles in the future.

          I also give mental health speeches at universities and businesses. As
          someone who has previously struggled, it's extra important for people
          who have been through it to help others understand who is going into
          that field. I have done speeches in places like The University of
          Manchester and Salford University. Based on my past experiences I give
