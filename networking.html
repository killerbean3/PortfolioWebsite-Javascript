        <h2>Router <span>Down</span></h2>
        <p>
          In this task, a site's network is offline due to its router being
          offline. This is a retail site so the router being down only allows
          them to do cash sales. This will affect the business heavily and their
          potential sales and profits. The router is a layer 3 part and handles
          the routing of data inside the network and the data coming in and out
          of the network, it sends the data outside of the network via the
          default gateway. Due to the router being offline, data cannot leave
          the network and if it is fully offline, data cannot be moved locally
          or within the LAN. For example, the layer 2 switches won't be able to
          communicate with each other, leading to tills, PCs, tablets and more
          being offline too.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My task involves identifying the cause or causes of the router being
          down, troubleshooting it and finally bringing it back online making
          the store able to trade once again. The task may sound simple and be
          able to be typed in one sentence, but the process requires more steps.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When a router goes offline it will be alerted to us via our monitoring
          system called Pandora. For a router, it needs to be offline for 20
          minutes before it alerts us, this changes based on what it is, for
          example, a lease line or head office going offline is alerted after 2
          minutes and 4G routers are 60 minutes. When a router has been down for
          20 minutes it sends an email alert to our Outlook inbox when then
          automatically raises the email as a ticket to our ticketing system,
          Autotask. An example of our ticket is below. This ticket reference for
          this case was T20230829.0202.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/0.monitoring.PNG" alt="ticket" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          The official SLA for response time to a ticket like this is 1 hour and
          8 hours for a resolution if it doesn’t need external teams, like
          Openreach or an engineer visit. These SLAs are important as it helps
          the customer understand the time we need to complete something and
          when it’s expected to be back up.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next step is to ping the router as it could have come online since
          the ticket was raised or something else could have brought it back up
          and online. I use the PING command with the switch -t which makes the
          ping continuous. The ICMP packet will confirm whether the router is
          down.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/2. confirmed down.PNG" alt="ping" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          The continuous ping above shows that it has not been able to contact
          the router and has lost 100% of the packets it sent, meaning the
          router is still offline.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next step is to run a line test. A line test is testing both the
          PSTN(if using one) and ADSL/FTTC/FTTP line all the way to the site
          from the provider. The reason we test the lines is that if either of
          the lines are having issues, this can impact the site down the line.
          If the line had a fault that could be the probable reason to why the
          router is down. For testing the PSTN we go through a portal called
          Abillity.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we log in to Abillity, then we select WLR3 Tools. The you put
          the CLI into he box and confirm the postcode. You are then able to run
          a test.
        </p>
        <img src="images/3. wlr3.PNG" alt="lines" class="pphotos" />
        <img src="images/8. test.png" alt="result" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          In this case, the test passed, so we moved on to testing the ADSL part
          of the line. If this failed and had a fault we would raise this to
          Openreach and if the site pays for a 4G drop-in service, provide a
          temporary router. To test the DSL part of the line, this site uses TTB
          as the provider and can be completed by doing the following.
        </p>
        <img src="images/4. Check in sync.PNG" alt="sync" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          First, we log in and go to supportal, when we are there, we put in the
          CLI. We can then check if the line is in sync or not. In this case the
          line isn’t in sync so you will have to run a line test, but if it is
          in sync, then we can do a port reset. A port reset drops the port in
          the exchange and forces the router to reauthenticate, this can solve
          some issues with the router as if it is in sync but not authenticating
          you will get no internet. Since the line isn’t in sync we move to the
          next step.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we select the service LLU and put in the CLI, this will populate
          the information about the line and allow you to run a line test,
          called a TAM test here. LLU stands for Local loop unbundling, and this
          allows for companies other than BT to give out broadband using
          Openreach lines. This means that TTB is using ORs lines to provide
          broadband to us.
        </p>
        <img src="images/5. LLU.PNG" alt="llu" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          So, then we select TAM test and issue and it will show the result once
          complete. Once ran, it will show a result like below.
        </p>
        <img src="images/6. LLU result.PNG" alt="result" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          Since both line tests passed this means that the fault isn’t with the
          line but with the equipment on site. To test on-site equipment there
          are many steps, but we always do initial checks first as there isn’t
          much point in sending an engineer when we can bring the router back
          online over the phone if it is switched off for example. So, we do the
          initial checks over the phone to save time and make the work more
          efficient. When we call the site, we will check the lights that are at
          the front of the device as this will give us an indicator of what is
          going on here, for example, this site Had the PWR, SYS and VDSL lights
          on, but we also expect the PPP light on (Point to point protocol). Due
          to the PPP light not being on this will indicate an issue with the DSL
          cable as we send PPP over the line, but it’s getting a signal from the
          line as the VDSL light is on. So first we unplug the RJ11 cable from
          the router and plug it back in, when then do the same for the side
          that is connected to the filter into the master socket on the wall.
          This is due to over time it can get loose or tugged on and come loose.
          Usually, this can bring it back online and we run a continuous ping
          anyway just to see if it helps but it’s good practice to reboot the
          kit too as it gets a fresh connection and startup. We ask the site to
          unplug the power, wait 10-15 seconds then plug it back in. After this,
          we monitor the site to make sure comms return and the site is back
          online. In this case, the site starts to get successful pings as it
          comes back online showing that the router is getting a connection and
          is online. Shown below is the successful ping response.
        </p>
        <img src="images/7. online.PNG" alt="test" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          I sent 47 ICMP packets and it was 100% successful. The reason we send
          so many is to make sure that the site is successfully stable. If the
          site had been down for an extended period, we may continue to monitor
          for a period of time to make sure nothing goes wrong with the site as
          it has been down for a while, when closing we would write something
          similar to the below.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/closing intermiitent.PNG"
          alt="intermittent"
          class="pphotos"
        />
        <p>
          When closing the case we need to give proof it has been stable. The
          above photo shows our radius logs. This is a tool we use where we have
          a file with all the logins for the sites for PPP authentication. Every
          time a router authenticates it uses the logins from the USERS file on
          the radius server and connects to the internet using the PPP details
          stored. Every time a site successfully authenticates with the line and
          USERS file makes a log which is then stored on the radius. This allows
          us to see how many times a router authenticates with us allowing us to
          check if the connection is stable, if it is authenticating a lot then
          it shows that the connection isn’t stable. And it would need to be
          looked at. As you can see in the red circle it hasn’t needed to
          authenticate for the last week which means it has held that same
          connection without issue. The other piece of proof we provide is a
          standard ping response to show it’s currently online. If it has been
          down for a short period of time then we would use a closing message
          like below.
        </p>
        <img src="images/closing standard.PNG" alt="standard" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          This is obviously less detailed in showing that it has been stable as
          it isn’t referencing the radius logs, but it does explain what we did
          to bring it back online and shows a ping response as proof that it is
          online and currently online. Doing an in-depth stability check isn’t
          always required if the network went down briefly and was stable before
          as it could be as simple as it being accidentally unplugged. We still
          explain what we did to bring it online, but we don’t explain that we
          are going to monitor it as it isn’t required. This keeps the network
          security at a high level as the firmware versions we use are tested
          and have minimal flaws. The newest version is usually good but can
          have unforeseen bugs and flaws so it's important to use a version with
          a good knowledge base behind it. Overall, this was resolved in the
          first response which was 35 mins after the ticket was raised. This
          fulfils both the first response SLA of 1 hour and resolution SLA of 8
          Hours.

        <h2>VLAN <span>Configuration</span></h2>
        <p>
          For this task I had to add Vlan 1130 to two ports which were shutdown
          and only had a certain LAN range that didn't include Vlan 1130. Below
          is the ticket we received.
        </p>
        <img src="images/9.ticket.png" alt="ticket" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          A VLAN is a virtual local area network which is its own partitioned
          bit of the network at the data layer of the OSI model. Virtual in this
          sense means that it has been altered by the extra logic required for a
          VLAN to work. They work by applying a tag to make it function and
          appear as a single network but acts as if they are separate networks.
          It's fundamentally different to something like a subnet as it works on
          MAC addresses which is on layer 2 and subnets work on IP addresses
          which is on layer 3. It also has different amounts of use cases as
          VLANs can create different physical and logical addresses, on the
          other hand Subnets can only create logical networks within the same
          physical network.
        </p>
        <p>
          After having a look at the switch, I found that ports 20 - 24 were
          shutdown and only allowed ranges 1 - 1005 by using the command sh
          interface status. My tasks were I had to bring the ports back online
          and allow the access through the new VLAN 1130.
        </p>
        <p>
          First I used the command <i>conf t</i> to get into the config, I then
          used <i>int fastEthernet 0/22</i> to get to port 22. I then did
          <i> shutdown</i>, to bring it back online and
          <i>switchport trunk allowed vlan add 1130</i> to add vlan 1130 to the
          allowed list over trunk. I then did the same for port 24
        </p>
        <img src="images/10 conf.png" alt="config" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          I then had to check the config by typing <i>sh run</i> to make sure
          the settings had applied. below shows that ports 22 and 24 are online
          and allowing vlan1130.
        </p>
        <img src="images/11.conf2.png" alt="config" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          We then showed the screenshots of it working and the switch passing
          vlan1130, which allowed us to close the case. Overall, this job took
          30 minutes for the first response and resolution which is within the
          1-hour response and 8-hour resolution time.

    <!-- port forwarding -->
    <section id="portforward" class="section">
      <div class="title">
        <h2>Port <span>Forwarding</span></h2>
        <p>
          This task a new site has installed 2 switches, and we will need to
          access them remotely for future configuration and troubleshooting. I
          was not at the site for this, but I was able to remotely access the
          router for the configuration of the port forwarding. <br />Port
          forwarding is part of Network Address Translation (NAT) that redirects
          requests from an IP and port to another while the packets are in
          transit. The is most commonly used to make services on a host which is
          in a private network available for external users. <br /><br />Typical
          applications include the following:
        </p>
        <p>&#x2022;Running a public HTTP server within a private LAN</p>
        <p>
          &#x2022;Permitting Secure Shell access to a host on the private LAN
          from the Internet
        </p>
        <p>
          &#x2022;Permitting FTP access to a host on a private LAN from the
          Internet
        </p>
        <p>
          &#x2022;Running a publicly available game server within a private LAN
        </p>
        <p>
          So first is had to enter sys mode which is similar to conf t on Cisco
          router but also some commands are hidden behind it like ssh etc. Once
          I am in system view, I must enter the dialler interface which I
          connected to the line and has the public ip assigned to it. I then
          type in this command:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            nat server protocol tcp global current-interface 2221 inside
            ip-address 22
          </em>
        </p>
        <img src="./images/21. commands.PNG" alt="commands" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          <em>nat server protocol tcp global</em> is that it's using a nat
          command with the protocol of tcp and that its global.
          <em>current-interface</em> is that it uses the current interface which
          is dialler1 2221 is the external port, we then give the private IP
          address then the internal port which is 22. You For the second switch
          we change the external port to 2222 and the ip address, below is the
          config for dialler1, circled is the new commands for port forwarding
          the switches.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/22. config.PNG" alt="config" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          Once you have ensured it is in the config you need to save it which is
          a simple as typing save which is shown below:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/23. save.PNG" alt="" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          After we have saved the config we need to make sure that the port
          forward is working now so what we can do is put the IP into putty with
          the port that it is allocated to which for switch 1 was 2221:

          This task was completed in 35 mins so the response and completion SLA
          was hit for this. I learnt about port forwarding on routers and how
          useful they can make troubleshooting for devices that we support that
          aren't directly connected to the router. I would of liked to do this
          with routers by manufacturers other than Huawei as it would show me
          how commands are different and it will help me develop this in the
          future.

        <h2>Router <span>Installation</span></h2>
        <p>
          One of the sites that we managed needed a new router as the current
          one was losing packets and sync. This was causing an issue with trade
          which means that it needs a replacement router installed and when we
          replace a router, we also replace the DSL cable and filter during this
          time if required. I was tasked with swapping the router and bringing
          the site back online to a stable connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing we need to do here is to install the new router and
          make sure it gains sync with the line. The old device was also a one
          access but faulty which increases the chances of it working on this
          line. The line we are installing this on is a DSL line which stands
          for digital subscriber line, the line was installed by Openreach which
          is standard for most homes but not guaranteed. We plug the filter into
          the socket on the wall and the DSL cable into the RJ11 connector in
          the filter that is for the modem and the RJ11 connector on the router.
          Usually, the sockets are labeled with the number of the line so if
          there were 2 you would know which one is which. Unfortunately, this
          one wasn't labeled, but there is only one line on-site with one
          termination, so this is highly likely to be the correct line. If there
          were 2 unlabelled sockets you can plug a phone into the socket and
          dial out with the phone to see the number. There are other lines that
          use a DSL terminal like FTTC which is fibre to the cabinet, that then
          uses copper to the property.
        </p>
        <img src="images/201. Cabling.png" alt="cabling" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          When I plugged in the power cable, I had to wait for the router to
          boot up and be able to gain sync. For this, I would need the status
          and IP light on the router. Eventually the router did have the correct
          lights on which means I can plug in a laptop into the router to check
          data passthrough. This router by default has no 802.11 trunk ports, so
          data can go through any of the RJ45 ethernet ports, but since some
          config is required, I am going to plug in my laptop to the console
          port on the router and this adapts from RJ45 to USB for it to connect
          to the laptop. Plugging into the console port allows us to access the
          router CLI. The reason we need to access the CLI of the router is that
          it is using the default config of the one access and we need to move
          our config onto the router for it to work correctly on site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we have logged onto the new router we need to transfer the new
          config over to the router. The protocol we will use for this is called
          the Trivial File Transfer protocol. This uses UDP port 69 without any
          encryption but as this is local the transfer protocol is fine for what
          we are doing. We set the config that we need to use and send it over
          TFTP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before this can be done, we need to configure the router to allow data
          through the TFTP protocol as this is disabled by default for security
          purposes. We also need to allow data passing on the port to get the
          new config sent over to the router. Using the correct commands on the
          router and using the right IP and port will allow me to send the data
          over.
        </p>
        <img src="images/203. conf.png" alt="conf t" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          conf t - this allows for configuration in the terminal <br />int gi
          1/0 - this goes into gigabit ethernet labelled 1/0 <br />
          ip add ip and mask - this sets the IP for that port <br />
          ip tftp source-interface gi 1/0 - this allows for tftp from port 1/0
          as the source <br />
          sh ip int bri - shows the interfaces briefly
        </p>
        <img src="images/204. tftp.png" alt="tftp" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          We use a program called Tftpd64 to transfer the config file to the
          router. We can then send the file over to the router.
        </p>
        <img src="images/205.update.png" alt="update" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          The update from the TFTP server has not been completed as shown below.
          We then can reboot the router to ensure the new configuration is on
          the router.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the router has been rebooted, we checked that all the kit can be
          plugged into the router and we can see that the devices are connected
          and able to access the internet. We use the sharp command to see if
          all the devices show up and then ping one of the devices to see if
          they respond, if they do we then need to check if they can access the
          internet.
        </p>
        <img src="images/206.ping.png" alt="ping" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          This shows the router can ping googles DNS server showing it can
          access the internet. Pinging local devices shows that they are
          connected to the router, and they can also access the internet. We
          also set the boot config to be the new one as we wouldn’t want to
          clear the config every time the router reboots itself, it also backs
          up its config every Sunday evening to make sure that even if the
          device somehow loses its config, it can be restored. This is also in
          contact with our Pandora software so if it does go down again, we can
          be alerted by our monitoring system. We can then work on it
          appropriately. I learned more about types of lines and how a
          configuration is installed on a one access router which does use the
          same commands as Cisco. I would have liked to do an FTTP install too,
          to learn more about fiber to the property.

        <h2>Fortinet Firewall <span>VPN Rule</span></h2>
        <p>
          We got this ticket below through for setting up and VPN tunnel to a
          customer's Azure services. Site to site VPN tunnels typically
          terminate on a firewall and router on both sides. They both used a
          preshared key or certificate to connect. Our business uses IPsec,
          ISAKAMP and IKE. IPsec is a secure network protocol suite that auths
          and encrypts packets to allow a secure connection between devices. IKE
          (internet key exchange) is a protocol used to set up a association in
          the IPsec suite. Our company support both versions 1 and 2 as some
          legacy devices only support V1 and by default V2 is aggressive and V1
          has the option to be aggressive or not. ISAKMP (Internet Security
          Association and Key Management Protocol) is like IKE but provides the
          framework for key authentication. There are 2 phases for a connection
          in IPsec, Phase 1 is The VPN devices negotiate an IKE security policy,
          authenticate each other, and establish a secure channel. Phase 2: The
          VPN devices negotiate an IPsec security policy to protect IPsec data.
        </p>

        <p>
          First off, the attached change form that was required was wrong as it
          was also a firewall change request not a VPN template that we require.
          We first had to get the required form so I sent the following response
          back to the customer:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/32. form.PNG" alt="form" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          After that we got the correct document back but the IPs on our side
          were not filled in and we require a change approver signing to allow
          the change to happen, this a security method to anyone from changing
          setting so malicious members cannot change settings. So I then had to
          go back and request a change approver, I also named the people that
          are able to approve this request.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./images/34. CHange approver.PNG"
          alt="change approval"
          class="pphotos"
        />
        <p>I then got back the form and approval which is shown below:</p>
        <img src="./images/33. Template.PNG" alt="template" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          In this document we need the IPs on our side and the IPs on the third
          parties side, which for this is the Azure service IPs, we also need
          the setting for phase 1 and 2 of the IKE-ISAKMP. We require the
          encryption, the hash, The Diffie-Hellman, version of IKE, how its
          authenticating(preshared key or certificate), password and lifetime in
          seconds. This information helps us to build the VPN setting or the
          change in the firewall so it allows access. Once we had the
          information, we needed I filled it in on our Firewall for the
          customer, due to use having all the information it makes it easier for
          us to just put it in and test it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We filled in the name as AzureVPN With the comments of the ticket
          reference. The gateway IP with it's interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          IPs provided by customer to the correct remote address which is their
          Azure service and the local IPs which is our IPs
        </p>
        <img src="./images/35. settings1.png" alt="settings" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          below is the rule that allows the traffic from the VPN to go to the
          Azure services and any other data to get redirected to a blackhole. A
          black Hole in networking is a place where incoming or outgoing traffic
          is silently discarded while not informing the source that the data
          didn't reach its intended location. They are essentially invisible
          without tracking lost packets.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/36. Settings 2.png" alt="setting" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          We have a policy set up for traffic going into the Azure tunnel and
          coming out. This allows for the traffic going in and out of the tunnel
          to be correctly directed and pushed through.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/37.Settings 3.png" alt="settings" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          We use a FortiGate 200F for the firewalls. A firewall is a security
          device that monitors the incoming and outgoing traffic and can choose
          whether to block or allow specific traffic based on a set of rules. A
          firewall can be hardware, software, SaaS or in the cloud. For VPN
          connections you would most likely have a firewall on each side
          although this isn't essential. We use a deny all for most sites with
          exceptions when required as we do have a set of defaults for allowing
          access and a change request for anything extra. This allows us to
          heavily control what we allow in and out of the network and see what
          has been stopped by us and if there is any pattern to it. The specific
          firewall we use has some extra features that allow us to keep known
          and zero-day viruses away. It supports Web and DNS security which
          includes DNS filtering which provides full visibility into DNS traffic
          while blocking high-risk domains, and protects against DNS tunnelling,
          DNS infiltration, C2 server ID and Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA).
          URL filtering leverages a database of 300M+ URLs to identify and block
          links to malicious sites and payloads. It also uses Zero-day threat
          prevention which entails Fortinet's AI-based inline malware
          prevention, our most advanced sandbox service, to analyse and block
          unknown files in real-time, offering sub second protection against
          zero-day and sophisticated threats across all NGFWs. The service also
          has a built-in MITRE ATTACK® matrix to accelerate investigations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had an issue with this as the Azure side and ours was set up but we
          weren't able to get traffic through the VPN by this response to the
          ticket:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/38. issue.PNG" alt="issue" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          When debugging we noticed that the Phase 1 was being rejected which
          usually means a mismatch in settings, we knew our side was correct as
          it get peer reviewed before it gets launched so we can ensure that it
          is correct so we sent this response back:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/39. response.PNG" alt="resp" class="pphotos" />
        <p>
          But it turns out the user had changed the password without use knowing
          so we got on a call with them to share the new password securely and
          ensure that it is the same. <br /><br />Once we had the correct
          password on each side got authentication on the logs for phase 2 and
          connection traffic from each side as shown below:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/40. response.PNG" alt="resp" class="pphotos" />
        <img
          src="./images/41. negotiation.png"
          alt="negotiation"
          class="pphotos"
        />
        <p>
          There were no longer failures in the logs and the Phase 2 was showing
          as a success which means we had a connected tunnel and traffic was
          going through it. The SLA for firewall changes is slightly different
          at 5 days for completion but if 3rd parties get involved the SLA is
          paused. This particular task was completed in 4 days and that was due
          to the comms back and forth between the customer, it slowed us down
          with the issue that we had which made it still within SLA but slower
          than usual for this. I learnt a lot about Fortinet firewalls and VPN
          tunnelling for this which will allow me to use this knowledge in the
          future. I would like to try this with other types of firewalls as they
          do vary between manufacturers, and it could be interesting to see how
          it changes between them. I think the way we do things with a form
          makes it easier and quicker for us to make the change as we have all
          the information we need straight away.
